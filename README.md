Context of the project:
Early computer games lacked the significant technical resources we have today. Taking hints from fantasy and role playing games, text based MUDs were developed. The acronym MUD itself originally refers Multi-User Dungeon, and largely focuses on a players navigation and interaction with a world conveyed entirely through text. The popularity of these types of games was largely seen in the late 1970s to 1980s. One of the most popular MUDs ever designed was the famous Zork which was originally created in 1977. This game had players collecting treasure throughout a mysterious land and encountering enemies and hazards, such as trolls and mazes. Our game Goblin Goblet is largely inspired by Zork and tries to emulate its design and feel. The game has the player navigate a dungeon looking for artifacts and solving puzzles that allow them to access other parts of the dungeon and eventually make their way to the Goblin Goblet. Working in the genre of the text based adventure forced us to consider limitations in information conveyance and movement in an environment only conveyed with characters on a computer terminal. We were able to implement the players movement throughout a variety of different rooms, limit their navigation depending on current environmental factors, allow them to pick up items in the environment and to store them in their inventory, and interact with characters that could either help or hinder them on their adventure. The program was written in C and used a design philosophy centered around object structures in which items, rooms, characters, and even interactions were are all modeled as compact entities with attributes for interaction with the player. In true Zork fashion, the game also includes an illustrated map of the game to help players figure out the puzzles and challenges within. Each room in the map has a small picture outlining the rooms theme as to give players hints about the rooms purpose. We both had a lot of fun making this game and each learned a lot from to.
